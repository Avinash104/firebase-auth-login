## This repo provides two facilities

1. Setup of a React form for Signing up and logging with firebase
2. Setup of a login method via Google accout

### Note: This work rely on CDN Tailwind to minimise the complexity.

## Forseeable upgrades planned

1. Add Redux store to manage logged in user state.
2. Add Redux Persist to allow the user to remain signed in.
3. Might add Stripe component on top of it eventually.
4. Possible addition of backend to control the logging flow for learning purposes.
